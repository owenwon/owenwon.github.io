        <h2><a href="https://foreword-647d3.web.app/" target="_blank">Foreword</a></h2>
        <p>Foreword is a social reading platform I built with React, Firebase, and the OpenLibrary API. Users can discover books, share reviews, and interact with a community of readers. Beyond the technical implementation, this project gave my team and I the chance to really dive into the software development cycle. We practiced defining functional requirements, making architectural decisions, writing specifications, and rigorously testing and debugging. The result was a polished MVP that I am immensely proud of, and a much deeper understanding of how to take an idea from concept to working product.</p>
        <h2><a href="https://taiiwininfo441.me/" target="_blank">Bop It!</a></h2>
        <p>Bop It! was a fun challenge of a project where my team and I recreated the classic game as a full-stack web application. Built with React, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, it featured secure login with Azure AD, real-time score tracking, and a competitive leaderboard. The main focus here was on the backend functionality, includingdesigning RESTful APIs, handling game logic, and ensuring user data persisted reliably. Choosing such a fun concept made the process of learning backend development both memorable and rewarding.</p>
        <h2><a href="https://kanpet-1ec9a.web.app/" target="_blank">KanPet</a></h2>
        <p>KanPet was my first web app, a gamified task manager inspired by kanban boards. This project focused on frontend functionality, where my team and I designed the interface in Figma and Miro, then implemented it with React using Hooks-based state management. Users can create dynamic boards, track milestones, and earn cosmetic rewards for task completion. For me, the learning came from bridging design and implementation. This meant taking wireframes and turning them into functional features, while also considering how design choices affect usability and motivation.</p>
