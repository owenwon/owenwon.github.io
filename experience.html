      <h1>My Experience</h1>
      
      <div class="experience-section">
        <h2>Coding Instructor @ Coding With Kids</h2>
          <p>At Coding with Kids, I was responsible for teaching programming fundamentals in multiple languages—including Java and Scratch—to students ranging from elementary school to high school. I designed and delivered lessons that balanced theory with hands-on practice, providing one-on-one support for debugging and problem-solving. Through this role, I developed strong technical communication skills and honed my ability to translate complex programming ideas into easily understandable explanations.</p>
        <h2>Swim Instructor @ Lake Union Swim Academy</h2>
          <p>As a swim instructor at Lake Union Swim Academy, I learned how to translate years of swimming experience into clear, simple steps. I was tasked with teaching a wide range of students—from young children entering the water for the first time to adults learning later in life. I learned to adjust my teaching not only to the skill level of each class but also to the individual needs of each student. Seeing the joy in my students who had done something they never thought was possible sparked my passion for teaching and reinforced my belief in lifelong learning. Through these experiences, I developed patience, communication skills, and the ability to connect meaningfully with people of all ages.</p>
        <h2>Lifeguard @ City of SeaTac</h2>
          <p>As a lifeguard at Angle Lake, I was responsible for ensuring public safety in a dynamic open-water environment. Unlike my previous experience at a pool, the lake presented unpredictable weather, reduced visibility, and underwater hazards, requiring constant vigilance and quick decision-making. I regularly managed large, diverse crowds, often communicating with non-English-speaking visitors, which strengthened my adaptability, patience, and customer service skills. Over the season, I performed multiple rescues, including saving two individuals from drowning and administering first aid to many others. These experiences sharpened my ability to remain calm and effective in high-pressure, life-or-death situations.</p>
        <h2>Lifeguard @ City of Vancouver</h2>
          <p>I had always been on the swim team growing up, so the summer after my senior year, I worked as a lifeguard for my community's pool. I learned essential life-saving skills, including CPR, first aid, and in water rescues. Additionally, I was tasked with running the pool's front desk, where I gained valuable soft skills in customer service and communication.</p>
